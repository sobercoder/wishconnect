wishconnect
===========

A cross-platform Java-based authentication tool for Wishnet broadband users. This application opens up a simple dialog where users can enter their username/password and start using the broadband service. The credentials, once entered, are locally stored in a secure manner so that users do not have to re-enter them each time they login.
